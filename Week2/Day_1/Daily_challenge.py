#Daily Challenge: Old MacDonald’s Farm

"""Instructions : Old MacDonald’s Farm

Take a look at the following code and output:
File: market.py

macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
macdonald.add_animal('cow',5)
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
print(macdonald.get_info())
Output

McDonald's farm

cow : 5
sheep : 2
goat : 12

    E-I-E-I-0!


Create the code that is needed to receive the result provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:

Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?
Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
How many methods does the Farm class need?
Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?
Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.


Expand The Farm

Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class. This method should return a sorted list of all the animal types (names) in the farm. 
With the example above, the list should be: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep'].

Add another method to the Farm class called get_short_info. 
This method should return the following string: “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheeps.”. 
The method should call the get_animal_types function to get a list of the animals.
Note : In English the plural form of the word “sheep” is sheep. 
But for the purpose of the exercise, let’s say that if there is more than 1 animal, an “s” should be added at the end of the word."""

class Farm:
    def __init__(self, farm_name) -> None:
        self.name = farm_name
        self.animals = {}
        
    def add_animal(self, new_animal, number = 1):
        if new_animal in self.animals:
            self.animals[new_animal] += number
        else:
            self.animals[new_animal] = number

    def get_info(self):
        print(f"{self.name}'s farm")
        for animal, count_animals in self.animals.items():
            print(animal, ":", count_animals)
        return "\n E-I-E-I-0!"
    
    def get_animal_types(self):
        self.animal_list = []
        for animal in self.animals.keys():
            self.animal_list.append(animal)
        self.animal_list.sort()
        return self.animal_list
    def get_short_info(self):
        print(f"{self.name}’s farm has {self.animal_list[0]}s, {self.animal_list[1]}s and {self.animal_list[2]}s.")
